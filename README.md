# roadaccidentsanalysis
## Overview
This project aims to create a linear regression model to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors such as weather conditions, road conditions, time of day, and vehicle count. The model is built using Python and utilizes libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Joblib for data manipulation, model training, and saving the model for future use.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is synthetic and includes the following features:
- `weather_condition`: Coded representation of weather (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy).
- `road_condition`: Coded representation of road conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy).
- `time_of_day`: Coded representation of the time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening).
- `vehicle_count`: The number of vehicles involved in the accident.
